## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Astralis is a multi-layered quantitative platform designed for the systematic exploitation of inefficiencies in the professional football wagering markets. Built on the principles of **Kinetic Efficiency Modeling** and **Recursive Bayesian Inference**, the suite moves beyond the limitations of standard retail handicapping by treating game outcomes as a function of physical invariants—primarily Trench Warfare and Early Down Success.

Through the integration of extreme-density play-by-play data and multi-stage ensemble voting, Astralis has achieved a statistically significant outperformance over the global market-maker baseline (Closing Line) across multiple seasonal cycles. This repository serves as both the operational execution layer and the primary research archive for the Astralis Quantitative Strategy Division.

## 2. THE TRIAD ENGINES

Astralis operates through three specialized sub-systems, each targeting a distinct pillar of the betting marketplace.

| Engine | Market | Methodology | Innovation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **ORION** | Point Spread | Recursive Partitioning Regression | Trench-Induced Sparse Attention (TISA) |
| **PULSAR** | Total Points | Kinetic Flow Volume Modeling | Weather Entropy Shield (WES) |
| **QUASAR** | Moneyline | Bayesian Probabilistic Classification | Dynamic Underdog Bias Correction (DUBC) |

## 5. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
The Astralis system is built on a distributed, micro-service-inspired architecture designed for maximum throughput and zero-data-loss integrity.
- **The Ingestor Layer (SIL)**: A high-concurrency scraping and normalization engine.
- **The Synthesis Layer (FSL)**: A massive feature engineering pipeline (200+ tensors).
- **The Ensemble Heart (ECH)**: The core predictive manifold housing the Orion, Pulsar, and Quasar engines.

For detailed MLOps and Infrastructure specs, please consult **Section 7** of the **[Master Technical Report](docs/ASTRALIS_TECHNICAL_REPORT.md)**.
