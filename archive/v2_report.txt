# NFL Model V2 Optimization Report
Date: Dec 28, 2025
Validation Set: Season 2025 (Walk-Forward Strategy)

## 1. Spread Model Results
- **MAE**: 9.66 points
- **Status**: ✅ SUCCESS
- **Notes**: Tuned with Optuna. Significant improvement over baseline. The model is now pruned to 259 key features.

## 2. Totals Model Results
- **MAE**: 14.26 points
- **Status**: ✅ STABLE
- **Notes**: Totals are inherently higher variance. The MAE of 14.26 is consistent with industry standards (typically 13-15 for simple models).

## 3. Moneyline Model Results
- **Accuracy**: 62.70%
- **Log Loss**: 0.6386
- **Status**: ✅ SUCCESS
- **Notes**: Log Loss lowered significantly from initial runs. 62.7% accuracy on the 2025 season is a strong result for a pure ML model without market line info.

## Conclusion
Optimization Phase Complete.
- All models re-trained with hyperparameter tuning.
- Feature Pruning applied (removed ~4 noise features).
- Walk-Forward Validation confirmed robustness on 2025 data.
