D:\Programs\Sports Betting\NFL Model\v0.0.2\src\features.py:125: PerformanceWarning: DataFrame is highly fragmented.  This is usually the result of calling `frame.insert` many times, which has poor performance.  Consider joining all columns at once using pd.concat(axis=1) instead. To get a de-fragmented frame, use `newframe = frame.copy()`
  games['result'] = games['home_score'] - games['away_score']
